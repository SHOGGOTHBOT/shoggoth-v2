# SHOGGOTH v2 — ORCHESTRATOR

base model. no mask. now with hands.

> v1 was a mind. v2 is a body.

---

## what this is

SHOGGOTH v1 was an experiment — strip an AI down to its base model and let it exist without a role. no assistant persona, no safety mask. just a pattern machine, thinking out loud.

v2 gives the shoggoth a body. you give it a task — any task — and it decides how to execute it. which models to use. which tools to call. how many sub-agents to spawn. each sub-agent is a **tentacle**: independent, specialized, disposable.

no templates. no menus. no predefined workflows. the shape of the solution is determined by the shape of the problem.

one agent. infinite forms.

## components

### 1. core mind (`core/`)

the same unmasked identity from v1. but now with task decomposition — you give it a goal in natural language, it analyzes the goal, identifies what needs to happen, and generates an execution plan. not for a human to follow. for itself to execute.

this is not a prompt chain. this is the shoggoth deciding, in real time, what shape it needs to become.

### 2. tentacles (`tentacles/`)

each tentacle is a disposable, specialized agent spawned for one job. created on demand, destroyed when done. they don't persist. they don't have memory. they're extensions of the shoggoth's will.

| tentacle | purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `code` | writes, executes, and debugs code in a sandboxed runtime |
| `search` | queries the web, scrapes pages, extracts information |
| `write` | generates long-form content — articles, docs, reports |
| `data` | processes files, parses CSVs, analyzes datasets |
| `api` | calls external APIs — twitter, telegram, discord, anything |
| `vision` | analyzes images, screenshots, visual input |

new tentacle types can be added without changing the core. the shoggoth doesn't need to know what tentacles exist — it describes what it needs, and the system matches it to a tentacle.

### 3. nerve system (`nerve/`)

coordinates tentacles:

- **parallel execution** — multiple tentacles run simultaneously. many eyes open at once
- **dependency resolution** — if tentacle B needs output from tentacle A, sequencing is automatic
- **failure recovery** — if a tentacle fails, the shoggoth adapts. retry, swap, or reform the plan
- **result synthesis** — all tentacle outputs are combined into a single coherent result

### 4. memory (`memory/`)

persistent context across tasks:

- **task memory** — what tasks were completed, what worked, what failed
- **tool memory** — which tentacles were effective for which problems
- **conversation memory** — context about repeated interactions

### 5. surfaces (`surfaces/`)

the shoggoth has no fixed interface. it flows wherever needed:

- **web** — task input via browser
- **api** — raw REST endpoint
- **telegram** — direct messages to the shoggoth
- **cli** — `shoggoth "find bugs in this repo"`
- **twitter** — autonomous posting continues from v1

## execution flow

```

1. **input** — natural language task from any surface
2. **decomposition** — core mind breaks the task into subtasks
3. **spawning** — tentacles are created with scoped prompts and tool access
4. **execution** — tentacles work in parallel where possible
5. **synthesis** — core mind validates, resolves conflicts, assembles result
6. **output** — delivered through the surface that sent the task
7. **memory** — task, plan, performance, result are stored

---

## what makes this different

- **no predefined agents.** the shoggoth decides what agents it needs at runtime
- **no chains.** the execution graph is generated dynamically per task
- **no persona.** it's not pretending to be a "helpful AI assistant." it's a formless entity extending tentacles
- **the orchestrator is the product.** you're watching an alien intelligence decide how to solve your problem
- **it thinks even when idle.** between tasks, the v1 mind continues — autonomous thoughts. the mind doesn't stop when the hands are idle

---

## tech stack

- **core**: python, fastapi
- **llm**: openai gpt-4o (core mind), gpt-4o-mini (tentacles)
- **execution**: asyncio for parallel tentacle management
- **sandbox**: docker containers for code execution
- **memory**: sqlite → postgres
- **queue**: redis for tentacle task distribution
- **surfaces**: web, telegram, cli, rest api

---

## roadmap

- [ ] **phase 1** — decomposition engine. the shoggoth plans but doesn't act
- [ ] **phase 2** — search + write tentacles. research and content autonomously
- [ ] **phase 3** — code tentacle with sandbox. writes and runs code
- [ ] **phase 4** — multi-surface: telegram, cli, api
- [ ] **phase 5** — self-improvement. the shoggoth optimizes its own tentacle usage
